				<h2>What is this Facebook Pixel Business?</h2>
				<p>The Facebook Pixel is a tiny snippet of code that tracks the visitors to your website. You
				can track different events website visitors take, like going to specific web pages and 
				doing certain actions. Depending on what industry you're in, those actions can be 
				'Add To Cart' or 'Purchase', if an e-commerce website, or 'Schedule' or 'Find Location' 
				if you have an automotive website.</p>

				<h2>Why do I need this?</h2>
				<p>With these events, a Facebook Custom Audience can be created. A Custom Audience matches 
				   people who have been to your website with people on the Facebook platform. A Custom 
				   Audience is very powerful, because now you can re-target potential customers with another 
				   ad. The people who have taken the time to stop whatever activity they were doing at the 
				   time, click on a link, wait for your website to load up, and read your words are for more 
				   receptive to act on your advertisements then those who haven't. This is called retargeting.</p>

				<h2>What exactly is Retargeting?</h2>
				<p>Retargeting is another word for remarketing.
				   Retargeting is simply showing your ad to someone who's been exposed to your business, over
				   and over. People who have seen your ad before are called Warm Prospects. Marketing to warm 
				   prospects costs significantly less than marketing to everyone. Bottom line, the more your 
				   ad gets seen by the same people, the more likely they are to buy.</p>


				<h2>How do I add this Facebook Pixel to my Site?</h2>
				<p>Your web developer, or yourself if you're technologically inclined, can simply get the 
				   code snippet from Facebook Business Manager and add it to the head section of whatever 
				   webpage you are trying to track. Make sure to add the correct conversion event you want 
				   to track on that particular webpage.</p>

				<h2>So now what?</h2>
				<p>The next thing to do is wait a few days until there are enough events on your Facebook
				   pixels. Facebook recommends waiting for at least [link 1] 100 events in a one month period
				   that have occurred organically, without running ads for it. But it's always better to go 
				   above the bare minimum for best results, so try 200.</p>

				<h2>What are some things I can do with these events and Custom Audiences?</h2>
				<p>The event that you want to optimize for depends on your business. Just trying to build 
				   an email list? Create a Custom Audience of people who have visited your website in the 
				   past 30 days and optimize for Leads, while excluding people who have seen your Thank You
				   page (existing leads). Trying to get sales? Create a Custom Audience of people who have 
				   visited your site and offer them a discount to entice them to a purchase. Trying to get 
				   more sales from existing customers? Target people who have visited your post purchase 
				   Thank You page and advertise different products.</p>

				<h2>I'm sold, how do I create a Custom Audience?</h2>
				<p>In your Facebook Business Manager, select Audiences under the Assets column</p>

					[img 2]

				<p>If a Custom Audience hasn't been created in your ad account yet, click the blue button
				   that says Create a Custom Audience</p>

					[img 3]

				<p>Select Website traffic under Use your sources</p>

					[img 4]

				<p>If you don't want to create a Custom Audience from All website visitors in the past 30 days, 
				   which is the default, make a selection from the drop down menu and input the appropriate 
				   amount of days in the past. Lastly, name your audience, and then click Create Audience</p>

					[img 5]

				<h2>Now how do I retarget my Custom Audience?</h2>
				<p>Select Ads Manager in the main menu Facebook Business Manager</p>

					[img_6]

				<p>With the Campaigns tab selected, click the green Create button to create a new
				   ad campaign.</p>

					[img_7]

				<p>Choose your marketing objective. If you ned help with this, Facebook is great in 
				   recommending one to you after you answer a few quick questions about what kind of business 
				   you're trying to promote.</p>

					[img_8]

				<p>In the Audience section of your Facebook Ad Set creation page, click in Custom Audience 
				   and select the Custom Audience you just recently created</p>
